# Cocos2D Swift Utils #

A collection of Cocos2d-Spritebuilder/ObjC helper classes and functions. Written in Swift.

This repo is partially inspired by (and borrows some code from) the Sprite Kit equivalent over at [Ray Wenderlich's] (https://github.com/raywenderlich/SKTUtils).

This repo is currently under construction.
