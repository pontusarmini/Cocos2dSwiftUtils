# Cocos2D Swift Utils #

![Cocos2d Swift Utils Icon](http://pontusarmini.com/content/images/2015/06/icon2.png)

A collection of Cocos2d-Spritebuilder/ObjC helper classes and functions. Swift only.

This repo is partially inspired by (and borrows some code from) the Sprite Kit equivalent over at [Ray Wenderlich's] (https://github.com/raywenderlich/SKTUtils).

This repo is currently under construction.
